## üöÄ Project Overview
Versionary is an image-based version control system designed to efficiently manage and track changes between image versions. The core of the system relies on **Merkle Trees** for secure and efficient version tracking. To further enhance processing, **grayscale conversion** reduces data complexity, and **Quadtrees** are used to break down images into smaller chunks. This combination allows Versionary to detect differences between versions, even in large images, making it a powerful tool for version control and visual quality assurance.
